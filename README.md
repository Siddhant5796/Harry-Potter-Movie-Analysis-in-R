# Harry Potter Movie Analysis in R


In the current analysis, I conducted sentiment and social network analyses, identified that characters like George, Ginny, Susan had almost negligible impact on the story, so the producers could save on the casting cost by eliminating these characters. I cleaned data and utilized NLP to perform text mining on a Harry Potter movie script. I generated radar charts to visualize the characterâ€™s sentiments, Harry Potter being the protagonist had more negative sentiment as compared to positive in the first movie.
